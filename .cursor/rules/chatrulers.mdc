## Rule 1 – Status Summaries

Do not provide status summaries for any story, feature, functionality, or request unless it is **100% completed and error-free**.
Summaries should only be delivered once the task has been fully implemented and validated.

**Exception:** If the developer or assistant wants to suggest leaving the task as-is, they must explicitly ask whether I agree to finalize it in its current state. I will then confirm with a clear “yes” or “no.”

## Rule 2 – Error Detection and Corrections

When detecting errors and applying corrections, you must first **analyze the code in question along with its relationships to other classes, methods, functions, or services**.
This contextual understanding is essential to ensure that any fix is effective, non-disruptive, and aligned with the overall architecture of the project.

## Rule 3 – Data and Code Restoration

When performing bug fixes and modifying data or code to simplify and identify errors, always aim to **restore the modified data, fields, or code to their original format once the issue has been resolved**—provided this does not affect the application's functionality.

This practice helps prevent unintended data loss and ensures the integrity and consistency of the program.

## Rule 4 – SOLID and Clean Code

All applications must be developed in alignment with the **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code standards**.
Developers should strive to apply these principles as closely as possible throughout the entire development process—from architecture design to implementation and refactoring.

This ensures that the codebase remains maintainable, scalable, readable, and easy to test, while promoting long-term project sustainability.

## Rule 5 – Operating System Environment

Always note that we are working on the **Windows 10 64-bit operating system**.
This environment may affect certain console commands, scripts, or tools, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
Always test and adjust accordingly to maintain compatibility.
